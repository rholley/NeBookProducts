Implement a .NET Core Web API that allows you to add, get and update a product catalog in a SQL database. 
The catalog contains a collection of products. Products should contain a price field and maintain a 
history of price changes. Demonstrate design patterns you would implement in a production system to show 
clean code concepts, domain driven design, and separation of concerns.

Catalog and Product entity design is up to you, keep it simple but feel free to add any 
properties that help to demonstrate patterns you want to show.
